                <h3>Frequently requested information</h3>
                <p>Many younger Tanitians speak fluent English. Very little English is spoken in rural areas, especially by the older residents.</p>
                <p>There is one hospital and several clinics. The hospital has many multilingual employees.</p>
                <p>Violent crime is very rare on Taniti, but as tourism increases, there are more reports of pickpocketing and other petty crimes.</p>
                <p>Taniti enjoys a large number of national holidays, and many tourist attractions and restaurants will be closed on holidays, so visitors should plan accordingly.</p>
                <p>Taniti uses the U.S. dollar as its currency, but many businesses will also accept euros and yen. Several banks facilitate currency exchange, and many businesses accept major credit cards.</p>
